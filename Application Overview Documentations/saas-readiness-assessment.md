## Detailed Gap Analysis

### 1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture (Critical Gap)

#### Current State
- Single database instance
- No tenant isolation
- Shared user accounts
- No subdomain/domain routing

#### Required Implementation
```sql
-- Multi-tenant schema design needed
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  subdomain VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  plan_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'basic',
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
  settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Row-level security for data isolation
ALTER TABLE bookings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_bookings_isolation ON bookings
  FOR ALL TO app_user
  USING (tenant_id = current_tenant_id());
```

#### Business Impact
- **Revenue Loss**: Cannot serve multiple customers
- **Scalability Limit**: Single customer per deployment
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Cannot compete with SaaS offerings

### 2. Scalability Infrastructure (High Priority)

#### Current Limitations
- SQLite file-based database
- Single server deployment
- No horizontal scaling capability
- Limited concurrent user support

#### Required Infrastructure
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment needed
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: boom-booking-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: boom-booking-api
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: boom-booking:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

#### Performance Targets
- **Concurrent Users**: 1,000+ active users
- **Response Time**: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Throughput**: 1,000+ bookings per hour

### 3. Security & Compliance (Critical Gap)

#### Current Security State
- Basic JWT authentication
- No encryption at rest
- No audit logging
- No access controls

#### Required Security Implementation
```javascript
// Enterprise-grade authentication needed
const authConfig = {
  providers: {
    oauth: ['google', 'microsoft', 'saml'],
    mfa: 'totp',
    sso: 'saml2'
  },
  encryption: {
    atRest: 'AES-256',
    inTransit: 'TLS 1.3'
  },
  compliance: {
    gdpr: true,
    ccpa: true,
    sox: false,
    hipaa: false
  }
};
```

#### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data export, deletion, consent management
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and audit trails
- **CCPA**: California privacy compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### 4. Billing & Subscription Management (Critical Gap)

#### Current State
- No payment integration
- No subscription management
- No usage tracking
- No pricing tiers

#### Required Implementation
```javascript
// Stripe integration needed
const billingConfig = {
  provider: 'stripe',
  plans: {
    basic: { price: 29, features: ['5_rooms', '100_bookings'] },
    pro: { price: 79, features: ['20_rooms', '1000_bookings'] },
    enterprise: { price: 199, features: ['unlimited', 'api_access'] }
  },
  billing: {
    interval: 'monthly',
    trial: 14,
    cancellation: 'immediate'
  }
};
```

#### Revenue Model
- **Freemium**: Basic plan with limitations
- **Tiered Pricing**: Feature-based pricing
- **Usage-based**: Pay-per-booking model
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing and features

### 5. Observability & Monitoring (High Priority)

#### Current State
- Basic console logging
- No error tracking
- No performance monitoring
- No alerting system

#### Required Monitoring Stack
```yaml
# Observability stack needed
services:
  - prometheus: # Metrics collection
  - grafana: # Visualization
  - jaeger: # Distributed tracing
  - sentry: # Error tracking
  - datadog: # APM and logging
```

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Business Metrics**: Bookings per hour, revenue, churn rate
- **Technical Metrics**: Response time, error rate, availability
- **User Metrics**: Active users, session duration, feature usage

### 6. Data Management & Backup (Medium Priority)

#### Current State
- No backup strategy
- No disaster recovery
- No data migration tools
- No data retention policies

#### Required Implementation
```bash
# Automated backup strategy
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup script
pg_dump boom_karaoke_prod | gzip > /backups/daily/$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
aws s3 cp /backups/daily/$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz s3://boom-backups/daily/
```

#### Data Management Requirements
- **Backup Frequency**: Daily automated backups
- **Retention Policy**: 30 days local, 1 year cloud
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour
- **Data Export**: Customer data portability

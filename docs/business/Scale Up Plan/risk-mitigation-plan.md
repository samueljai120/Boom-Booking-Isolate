# 1. Create full backup
pg_dump boom_karaoke_prod > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Validate data integrity
python validate_data_integrity.py --source=sqlite --target=postgresql

# 3. Test migration in staging
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
python migrate_data.py --dry-run

# 4. Performance testing
artillery run tests/performance/database-migration.yml

echo "Migration validation completed successfully"
```

**Contingency Plans**:

## AI-Powered Features That Save Time & Money

### 1. Demand Forecasting AI
**Problem**: Venues lose 20% revenue due to poor capacity planning  
**Solution**: AI predicts demand 30-90 days ahead with 85% accuracy
```python
# AI Demand Forecasting
def predict_venue_demand(venue_id, date_range):
    # Analyze historical patterns
    historical_data = get_historical_bookings(venue_id)
    
    # Factor in external variables
    weather_data = get_weather_forecast(date_range)
    events_data = get_local_events(date_range)
    seasonality = get_seasonal_patterns(venue_id)
    
    # Generate predictions
    predictions = ai_model.predict({
        'historical': historical_data,
        'weather': weather_data,
        'events': events_data,
        'seasonality': seasonality
    })
    
    return predictions
```

### 2. Dynamic Pricing Engine
**Problem**: Static pricing leaves money on the table  
**Solution**: AI adjusts prices in real-time based on demand
```python
# Dynamic Pricing AI
def optimize_pricing(venue_id, time_slot):
    demand_forecast = predict_demand(venue_id, time_slot)
    competitor_prices = get_competitor_prices(venue_id)
    historical_conversion = get_conversion_rates(venue_id)
    
    optimal_price = pricing_ai.calculate({
        'demand': demand_forecast,
        'competition': competitor_prices,
        'conversion': historical_conversion,
        'venue_capacity': get_venue_capacity(venue_id)
    })
    
    return optimal_price
```

### 3. Staff Intelligence
**Problem**: Over/under-staffing costs 15% of labor budget  
**Solution**: AI predicts optimal staffing levels
```python
# Staff Optimization AI
def optimize_staffing(venue_id, date):
    predicted_demand = predict_demand(venue_id, date)
    staff_availability = get_staff_availability(venue_id, date)
    skill_requirements = get_skill_requirements(venue_id, date)
    
    optimal_schedule = staffing_ai.optimize({
        'demand': predicted_demand,
        'availability': staff_availability,
        'skills': skill_requirements,
        'labor_costs': get_labor_costs(venue_id)
    })
    
    return optimal_schedule
```
